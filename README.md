# Scripts
These are the scripts used in all my experiments. 
Some may contain code which imports different datasets or handle different sizes of data. 
It allowed me to be flexible, e.g. quick testing.

Names of the scripts reflect the model or their purpose, e.g. vgg_rep.py loads the profiles & converts them to the vgg representation.
